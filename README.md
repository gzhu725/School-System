# School-System

A program with abstract classes, methods, and inheritance to emulate a school system. Students can choose electives, get their own information. Teachers can view their rosters, add students to them, and give students recommendations.

more improvements: no exception handling (really helpful to do this for scanner)
adding loops/recursion to loop thru student/teacher log in so that you don't have to log in after each action.
